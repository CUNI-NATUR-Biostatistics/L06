# Website publishing

The committed HTML files are deployed without rerendering QMD source files on GitHub.

Pushing a matching HTML or manifest change to `main` publishes the instructor preview. It does not create a release and does not notify the course hub.

- `/LXX/preview/` contains the latest committed learning materials and presentation HTML from `main`.
- `/LXX/current/` contains the newest tagged stable release.
- `/LXX/releases/<tag>/` contains an immutable tagged release.

Create a stable release only after the locally rendered HTML and PDF files have been reviewed and committed. Tags use the form `LXX-vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-YYYYMMDD[-moodle]`.

The course hub links only to stable materials. Preview URLs are public but are intended for instructor review.

GitHub Pages must be configured once with **Source: GitHub Actions**. The `github-pages` environment must allow deployments from `main` and the lesson tag pattern `L06-v*`.
